## INITIAL GO MODULE SETUP

### Question: "go mod init what is it followed by and why should we run this"

**Answer:**
- `go mod init <module-name>` initializes a new Go module
- Module name is typically your project's import path (e.g., `github.com/username/projectname`)
- Creates a `go.mod` file that declares your project as a Go module
- Enables Go's modern dependency management system

### Example Commands:
```bash
go mod init readwise
go mod init github.com/shreyaanumkonda/readwise-go
```

### Error Encountered:
```bash
go mod init https://github.com/shreyaanumkonda/readwise-go.git
# Error: malformed module path "double slash"
```

**Fix:** Remove `https://` and `.git`:
```bash
go mod init github.com/shreyaanumkonda/readwise-go
```

---

## BASIC POINTER CONCEPTS

### Question: "Why is my go.mod file not have a symbol"

**Answer:**
- `.go` files have Go language symbols
- `.mod` files are plain text configuration files
- This is normal - `go.mod` doesn't need symbols

### What are Pointers?

**Definition:** A variable that stores the memory address of another variable

### Key Operators:
- **`&`** = Address-of operator (gets memory address)
- **`*`** = Two uses:
  1. In type declaration: `*int` means "pointer to int"  
  2. In expression: `*age` means "dereference age"

### Memory Layout Example:
```
Memory:
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│     age    │───→│   userID    │
│  (pointer) │    │   (value)   │
│  stores    │    │     100     │
│  address   │    │             │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
```

## DETAILED POINTER EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Basic Pointer Usage

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	userID := 42
	fmt.Println(&userID) //will print the address of userID
	anotherUserID := &userID
	fmt.Println(anotherUserID) //will print the address of userID
	//now what happens if we change the value of userID
	userID = 100
	fmt.Println(userID)         //the value of userID is changed as in overridden
	fmt.Println(&userID)        //the address of userID is still the same
	fmt.Println(anotherUserID)  //the address of anotherUserID is still the same
	fmt.Println(*anotherUserID) //the value of the box that anotherUserID is pointing to is changed
	// and this is how we also access the value of the box through pointer

	//fmt.Println(*userID)        //will give error as userID is not a pointer but an integer so we can't dereference it

	//now that we are talking about it, the * operator is also used to declare a type pointer
	var age *int //age is a pointer to an integer and it is not initialized
	fmt.Println(age) //will print nil as age is a pointer to an integer and it is not initialized
	age = &userID //if we want to assign the value of userID to age, we need to use the & operator
	fmt.Println(*age) //will print the value of userID //dereferencing the pointer to get the value

	//you can also pass pointers to the functions
	update(age, 42)
	fmt.Println(*age) //will print the value of userID which is 42 as the value of userID is updated to 42
}
func update(val *int, to int){
	*val = to
}
```

### Question: "Why can't I use *userID since userID is an int?"

**Answer:** 
- You can't dereference `*userID` because `userID` is an `int`, not a pointer
- `*` is the dereference operator for pointers
- You can only use `*` on pointer types, not on value types
- **Fix:** Remove the `*` from `*userID`

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **`userID := 42`**
   - `userID` is a variable
   - It stores an integer value 42
   - Type: `int` (a value type, not a pointer)

2. **`fmt.Println(&userID)`**
   - `&` = address-of operator
   - `&userID` means: "give me the memory address where userID is stored"
   - Prints something like `0xc0000140a0` (random memory location)

3. **`anotherUserID := &userID`**
   - "let anotherUserID hold the address of userID"
   - `anotherUserID` is now a pointer to an int (`*int`)
   - It stores "the place in memory where userID lives"

4. **`userID = 100`**
   - You're changing the value of userID
   - Now, inside memory, that same location stores 100 instead of 42

5. **`fmt.Println(*anotherUserID)`**
   - `*` = dereference operator
   - "go to the memory address stored in anotherUserID and fetch the value there"
   - Since anotherUserID points to userID, and userID = 100, this prints 100

6. **`fmt.Println(*userID)` ❌ ERROR**
   - `userID` is already an int, not a pointer
   - `*` only works on pointers
   - Trying `*userID` is like saying "dereference a plain number," which makes no sense

---

## FUNCTION PARAMETERS AND POINTERS

### Question: "What does 'dereference a plain number' mean?"

**Answer:**
1. **Dereference** = "follow the address to get the value stored there"
2. **Plain number** (like 42 or 100) = just a value, not an address
3. **The error** = You tried to use `*` on a variable that stores a number directly, not a memory address

### Example:
```go
x := 10
px := &x    // px = address of x
fmt.Println(*px) // dereference px → go to that address → get value 10

// But this is wrong:
x := 42
fmt.Println(*x) // ❌ ERROR: x is 42 (a number), not an address
```

### Question: "What does `var age *int` mean?"

**Answer:**
- **`age`** = variable name
- **`*int`** = type (pointer to integer)
- **`*`** in type declaration means "pointer to"
- **`age`** will store memory addresses, not integer values

### Visual Example:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var number int = 30
    var age *int = &number  // age stores the address of number

    fmt.Println(number)  // prints 30
    fmt.Println(&number) // prints address, like 0xc0000140a8
    fmt.Println(age)     // same address as &number
    fmt.Println(*age)    // go to that address → print 30
}
```

Memory picture:
```
number ───> 30
   ^
   |
 age (pointer) ─── stores &number
```

### Function Example with Pointers:

```go
func setTo100(x *int) {
    *x = 100
}

func main() {
    n := 5
    setTo100(&n)
    fmt.Println(n) // 100 (changed original)
}
```

### Question: "I did not understand so first n has a value of 5 stored in it and then we called the function and passed the address of n and in that function that parameter is x *int which is int of type pointer and then?"

**Step-by-step flow:**

1. **`n := 5`**
   - n is a normal int
   - Memory: `n ───> 5`

2. **`setTo100(&n)`**
   - `&n` = address of n
   - We're passing that address into the function
   - Inside the function, x is now a pointer pointing to n
   - Memory: 
   ```
   n ───> 5
          ^
          |
          x (pointer inside setTo100)
   ```

3. **Inside the function: `*x = 100`**
   - x is a pointer
   - `*x` means: "go to the address stored in x and change the value there"
   - Since x points to n, this line changes the value of n directly
   - Memory after:
   ```
   n ───> 100
          ^
          |
          x
   ```

4. **Back in main**
   - After the function returns, n has been updated to 100
   - So `fmt.Println(n)` prints 100

**Key idea:** Passing `&n` lets the function reach into main's variable and change it, instead of working on a copy.

### Question: "Where did val come from? This is the function syntax right we can write any word?"

**Answer:** Exactly! `val` is just a parameter name in the function definition.

```go
func update(val *int, to int) {
    *val = to
}
```

**Breakdown:**
- `update` → function name
- `(val *int, to int)` → the parameters of the function
- `val *int` → means "val is a pointer to an int"
- `to int` → means "to is just an int value"

**You can use any name for the parameter:**
```go
func update(pointer *int, newValue int) {
    *pointer = newValue
}

// or even:
func update(p *int, n int) {
    *p = n
}
```

All work the same! The names don't matter outside the function.

## STRUCTS AND METHODS

### Question: "You can mutate values by passing a reference what does this mean?"

**Code Example:**
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type User struct {
	ID   int
	Name string
}

func (u User) updateName(name string) {
	u.Name = name
}

func main() {
	user := User{ID: 1, Name: "John"}
	user.updateName("Jane")
	fmt.Println(user)
}
```

### Question: "What is a receiver and why do we need it?"

**Answer:**
- **Receiver:** The part before the function name that makes it a method
- **`(u User)`** = Value receiver (works on copy)
- **`(u *User)`** = Pointer receiver (works on original)

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Struct Definition:**
   ```go
   type User struct {
       ID   int
       Name string
   }
   ```
   Think of a struct as a box with multiple named values inside.

2. **Method Declaration:**
   ```go
   func (u User) updateName(name string) {
       u.Name = name
   }
   ```
   - `func` → defining a function
   - `(u User)` → receiver (makes updateName a method attached to User type)
   - `updateName(name string)` → method name and parameter
   - `u.Name = name` → assign the input name to the Name field of u

3. **Main Function:**
   ```go
   user := User{ID: 1, Name: "John"}
   ```
   This is called a **struct literal**. Creates a new User value.
   
   ```go
   user.updateName("Jane")
   ```
   Calls the method updateName on user. But since the receiver is `(u User)` (value receiver), Go copies the user struct into u. Changes happen only on the copy, not the original.

   ```go
   fmt.Println(user)
   ```
   Prints: `{1 John}` (not `{1 Jane}`, because the method modified only the copy)

### Value Receiver vs Pointer Receiver:

**Value receiver:**
```go
func (u User) updateName(name string) {
    u.Name = name
}
```
- Go makes a copy of the struct when you call the method
- You change the copy, but the original user stays the same
- Flow:
  ```
  user ──> {1 John}
  
  call updateName("Jane")
     u (copy) ──> {1 John}
     u.Name = "Jane"
     // u is now {1 Jane}, but user is still {1 John}
  ```

**Pointer receiver:**
```go
func (u *User) updateName(name string) {
    u.Name = name
}
```
- Go passes the address of user, not a copy
- Inside the method, you're working on the real object in memory
- Flow:
  ```
  user ──> {1 John}
     ^
     |
     u (pointer)
  
  call updateName("Jane")
     u.Name = "Jane"
     // modifies the real user in memory
  ```

### Question: "So it changed locally but not globally?"

**Answer:** Perfect! You got it right.
- **Value receiver** (u User) → changed locally, not globally
- **Pointer receiver** (u *User) → changes the original (globally)

### Terms Explained:
- **Copy** → Go makes a duplicate of the struct (like photocopy). Changes affect only the duplicate, not the original.
- **Pointer** → Instead of making a duplicate, Go gives the function the address of the original. So changes affect the original.

## CONSTRUCTORS AND APISERVER

### Basic APIServer Code:
```go
package main

type APIServer struct {
	addr string
}
func NewAPIServer(addr string) *APIServer {
	return &APIServer{addr: addr}
}
func (s *APIServer) Run(){
	
}
```

### Question: "What is the difference between these two functions here?"

**Answer:**

1. **`NewAPIServer`** - Constructor function (builds new struct)
   - Input: a string (addr)
   - Output: a pointer to a new APIServer
   - Job: build the struct and give it back (usually as a pointer)

2. **`Run`** - Method (operates on existing struct)
   - This is a method attached to the APIServer type
   - The part before the name `(s *APIServer)` is the receiver
   - Job: use or modify that struct's data (addr)

**Think of it like:**
- `NewAPIServer(":8080")` = "Make me a new car" 🔨
- `server.Run()` = "Drive this car" 🚗

### Question: "What is a constructor and why do we need it?"

**Answer:**
- **Constructor:** A function that creates and returns a new struct instance
- **Convention:** Function names start with `New<Type>`
- **Purpose:** Hide setup details, ensure proper initialization

**Example:**
```go
type User struct {
	ID   int
	Name string
}

// Constructor for User
func NewUser(id int, name string) *User {
	return &User{ID: id, Name: name}
}
```

**Why use a constructor?**
- To avoid repeating `User{ID: ..., Name: ...}` everywhere
- To enforce rules when creating the struct
- To ensure it's always returned as a pointer if needed

### Question: "So this is returning address to that struct right and why is the & written inside the code while * is written on top why not other way around?"

**Answer:**

1. **What does `&APIServer{addr: addr}` mean?**
   - `APIServer{addr: addr}` → creates a struct value
   - `&` → means "give me the address of this struct"
   - So: `&APIServer{...}` = pointer to the box

2. **Why `*APIServer` in the function signature?**
   - This is the return type
   - It tells Go: "This function will return a pointer to an APIServer"
   
   ```go
   func NewAPIServer(addr string) *APIServer {
       return &APIServer{addr: addr}
   }
   ```
   
   - `*APIServer` in the signature → the type of value we'll return
   - `&APIServer{}` in the body → the actual pointer we're returning

### Step-by-Step Constructor Flow:

1. **Struct definition:**
   ```go
   type APIServer struct {
       addr string
   }
   ```
   APIServer is like a blueprint with one field: addr.

2. **Making a struct manually:**
   ```go
   server := APIServer{addr: ":8080"}
   ```
   Memory: `server → { addr: ":8080" }` (this is a value, not a pointer)

3. **Taking the address with &:**
   ```go
   serverPtr := &APIServer{addr: ":8080"}
   ```
   Memory: `serverPtr → &{ addr: ":8080" }` (this is a pointer to the box)

4. **Constructor function:**
   ```go
   func NewAPIServer(addr string) *APIServer {
       return &APIServer{addr: addr}
   }
   ```
   - Return type: `*APIServer` → means "I promise to return a pointer to APIServer"
   - Return value: `&APIServer{addr: addr}` → actually builds the struct and gives its address

### Question: "Why do we choose to use pointers here?"

**Answer:**

1. **Efficiency** - Avoid copying large structs
2. **Mutability** - Methods can modify the original struct  
3. **State** - Server needs to maintain state across method calls

**Example of why pointers matter:**
```go
func (s *APIServer) Run() {
    // start server...
    // open network connections...
    // keep state while running...
}
```

That state must live in one place (the real server). If Go copied the server struct each time, the networking state would be disconnected.

### Complete Working Example:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

type APIServer struct {
	addr string
}

func NewAPIServer(addr string) *APIServer {
	return &APIServer{addr: addr}
}

func (s *APIServer) Run() {
	router := http.NewServeMux()
	
	router.HandleFunc("/hello", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		fmt.Fprintln(w, "Hello from API Server!")
	})
	
	fmt.Printf("Server starting on %s\n", s.addr)
	http.ListenAndServe(s.addr, router)
}

func main() {
	server := NewAPIServer(":8080")  // Create server
	server.Run()                      // Run server
}
```

### Question: "If my run function has a router how will it work then?"

**Step by step:**

1. **main:** `server := NewAPIServer(":8080")` creates `*APIServer{addr: ":8080"}`
2. **Call:** `server.Run()` - Go internally calls `Run(server)` where s becomes that pointer
3. **Inside Run:**
   - `router := http.NewServeMux()` - Creates a router object
   - `router.HandleFunc("/hello", ...)` - Define routes
   - `http.ListenAndServe(s.addr, router)` - Uses the addr field from your struct

**Why does this work?**
- Because of the pointer receiver: `s *APIServer` points to your struct
- Inside Run, `s.addr` still equals ":8080"
- That's how the server knows which port to bind to

### Question: "Where did :8080 come from and where else would we possibly need the constructor?"

**Answer:**

**Where :8080 came from:**
```go
server := NewAPIServer(":8080")  // You pass ":8080" here
```
- Constructor returns `&APIServer{addr: ":8080"}`
- Now the struct remembers that address inside its addr field
- Later when you call `server.Run()`, the method has access to `s.addr` (which is ":8080")

**Where else you'd need the constructor:**

Think about what a real server struct might hold:
```go
type APIServer struct {
    addr   string
    db     *sql.DB
    router *http.ServeMux
    logger *log.Logger
}

func NewAPIServer(addr string, db *sql.DB, logger *log.Logger) *APIServer {
    return &APIServer{
        addr:   addr,
        db:     db,
        router: http.NewServeMux(),
        logger: logger,
    }
}
```

**Constructor is useful whenever:**
- Your struct has required fields that must be set
- You want to hide setup details
- You want to prevent mistakes (e.g., forgetting to set addr)

## ESCAPE ANALYSIS

### Question: "Go has a feature called escape analysis what does that mean?"

**Answer:**

**Escape analysis** = Go's compiler optimization for deciding where to put variables in memory.

**Two memory locations:**
- **Stack** → fast, temporary, cleaned up automatically when function ends
- **Heap** → slower, managed by garbage collector, survives after function returns

**Example:**
```go
type User struct {
    Name string
}

func createUser(name string) *User {
    u := User{Name: name}
    return &u
}
```

**What happens:**
- `u` is a local variable in `createUser`
- Normally, locals live on the stack and vanish when function ends
- BUT we're returning `&u` → a pointer to u
- If u were on the stack, it would disappear after function ends → dangling pointer ❌
- So Go's compiler does escape analysis and says: "This value u escapes the function. I'll put it on the heap instead."

**Rule:** If variable "escapes" function scope, it goes to heap.

### Example Showing Escape vs No Escape:

```go
func createPointer() *int {
    x := 42
    return &x  // x escapes function, goes to heap
}

func stackExample() int {
    x := 10
    return x   // x stays on stack
}
```

### Question: "What will this print address or the value?"

**Code:**
```go
func createPointer() *int {
    x := 42
    return &x
}

func example() {
    p := createPointer()
    fmt.Println(*p)
}
```

**Answer:**
- `p := createPointer()` → p now holds the address of x (type `*int`)
- `fmt.Println(*p)` → `*p` means dereference the pointer
- **This prints 42** (the value)

**If you printed just p:**
```go
fmt.Println(p)  // This would print the address (0xc0000140b0 etc.)
```

**Clarification:**
- `*int` is a type: "pointer to int"
- `&x` → gives you a value of type `*int`
- `*p` → dereferences a pointer variable, giving you the actual int value

---

## GO STYLE GUIDELINES

### When in doubt, use a pointer receiver

**Guidelines from Go style guide:**
1. "When in doubt, use a pointer receiver"
2. "Prefer to make the methods for a type either all pointer methods or all value methods"
3. "Correctness wins over speed or simplicity"

### When to Use Pointers:

**✅ Use pointer receiver when:**
- You need to change the original struct fields
- The struct is large (copying it every time is slow)
- You want to mutate state
- You want to avoid copying the value

**❌ Use value receiver when:**
- The struct is small and simple
- The method doesn't need to mutate the data
- Working with "plain old data"

### Examples:

```go
type Buffer []byte

func (b Buffer) Len() int { 
    return len(b) 
}
```
Here Buffer is a slice. Slices are already references, so value receiver is fine.

```go
type Counter int

func (c *Counter) Inc() { 
    *c++ 
}
```
Here we must use pointer receiver because we're mutating the state.

### Performance Note:

The Go compiler does escape analysis and optimizations. Sometimes it passes values as pointers internally anyway. So: Don't prematurely optimize. Write for correctness + readability first.

## ALL CODE EXAMPLES

### 1. Basic Pointer Example:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	userID := 42
	fmt.Println(&userID) //will print the address of userID
	anotherUserID := &userID
	fmt.Println(anotherUserID) //will print the address of userID
	userID = 100
	fmt.Println(userID)         //the value of userID is changed
	fmt.Println(&userID)        //the address of userID is still the same
	fmt.Println(anotherUserID)  //the address of anotherUserID is still the same
	fmt.Println(*anotherUserID) //the value that anotherUserID is pointing to is changed
	
	var age *int //age is a pointer to an integer and it is not initialized
	fmt.Println(age) //will print nil
	age = &userID //assign the address of userID to age
	fmt.Println(*age) //will print the value of userID

	//you can also pass pointers to the functions
	update(age, 42)
	fmt.Println(*age) //will print 42
}

func update(val *int, to int){
	*val = to
}
```

### 2. Struct with Value Receiver:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

type User struct {
	ID   int
	Name string
}

func (u User) updateName(name string) {
	u.Name = name  // Changes copy only
}

func main() {
	user := User{ID: 1, Name: "John"}
	user.updateName("Jane")
	fmt.Println(user.Name)  // Still prints "John"
}
```

### 3. Struct with Pointer Receiver:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

type User struct {
	ID   int
	Name string
}

func (u *User) updateName(name string) {
	u.Name = name  // Changes original
}

func main() {
	user := User{ID: 1, Name: "John"}
	user.updateName("Jane")
	fmt.Println(user.Name)  // Prints "Jane"
}
```

### 4. APIServer Constructor Example:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

type APIServer struct {
	addr string
}

func NewAPIServer(addr string) *APIServer {
	return &APIServer{addr: addr}
}

func (s *APIServer) Run() {
	router := http.NewServeMux()
	
	router.HandleFunc("/hello", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		fmt.Fprintln(w, "Hello from API Server!")
	})
	
	fmt.Printf("Server starting on %s\n", s.addr)
	http.ListenAndServe(s.addr, router)
}

func main() {
	server := NewAPIServer(":8080")
	server.Run()
}
```

### 5. Escape Analysis Example:
```go
func createPointer() *int {
    x := 42
    return &x  // x escapes function, goes to heap
}

func example() {
    p := createPointer()
    fmt.Println(*p)  // prints 42
}
```

### 6. Function with Copy+Return Pattern:
```go
type User struct {
    ID   int
    Name string

## EVERY QUESTION AND ANSWER

### Q1: "go mod init what is it followed by and why should we run this"
**A:** `go mod init <module-name>` initializes a Go module. Creates `go.mod` file for dependency management. Module name is usually your import path.

### Q2: "Why is my go.mod file not have a symbol"
**A:** `.mod` files are plain text configuration files, not Go source code, so they don't get Go language symbols.

### Q3: "Why can't I use *userID since userID is an int?"
**A:** You can't dereference `*userID` because `userID` is an `int`, not a pointer. `*` only works on pointer types.

### Q4: "What does 'dereference a plain number' mean?"
**A:** It means you tried to use `*` on a variable that stores a number directly, not a memory address. You can't "go to" a plain number like you can with an address.

### Q5: "What does `var age *int` mean?"
**A:** This declares a pointer variable. `age` will store memory addresses of integers, not integer values themselves.

### Q6: "Why can't I assign `age = 10`?"
**A:** Because `age` is `*int` (pointer), not `int` (value). You need `age = &10` or create a variable first.

### Q7: "Where did val come from? This is the function syntax right we can write any word?"
**A:** Exactly! `val` is just a parameter name. You can use any name for parameters in function definitions.

### Q8: "* and & which is pointer and which is what i need proper terminologies to address"
**A:** 
- `&` = Address-of operator (gets memory address)
- `*` in type = Pointer type (`*int` means "pointer to int")
- `*` in expression = Dereference operator (gets value at address)

### Q9: "What is a receiver and why do we need it?"
**A:** Receiver is the part before function name that makes it a method. `(u User)` = value receiver, `(u *User)` = pointer receiver. It attaches functions to types.

### Q10: "What is this way of calling struct called?"
**A:** `user := User{ID: 1, Name: "John"}` is called a struct literal. It creates and initializes a struct.

### Q11: "So it changed locally but not globally?"
**A:** Perfect! Value receivers change locally (copy), pointer receivers change globally (original).

### Q12: "What is a constructor and why do we need it?"
**A:** Constructor is a function that creates and returns new struct instances. Convention: start with `New<Type>`. Hides setup details and ensures proper initialization.

### Q13: "Why do we choose to use pointers here?"
**A:** For efficiency (avoid copying), mutability (methods can modify original), and state (maintain consistent state across calls).

### Q14: "How do methods 'attach' to types?"
**A:** Any function with a receiver `(s *APIServer)` is automatically attached to that type. Go rewrites `server.Run()` as `Run(server)`.

### Q15: "What made it attach? There must be some underlying rule"
**A:** The rule: If you put `(x Type)` or `(x *Type)` before function name, Go turns that function into a method of Type.

### Q16: "Why can't it be `u *user` instead of `u *User`?"
**A:** Because receivers must use types, not variables. `User` (capital) is the type, `user` (lowercase) is a variable. Receivers need types.

### Q17: "Go has a feature called escape analysis what does that mean?"
**A:** Escape analysis is Go's way of deciding whether variables go on stack (fast) or heap (slower). If variable "escapes" function scope, it goes to heap.

### Q18: "What will this print address or the value?"
**A:** For `fmt.Println(*p)` it prints the value. For `fmt.Println(p)` it prints the address.

### Q19: "If my run function has a router how will it work then?"
**A:** The router is created inside Run() and uses `s.addr` from the struct. The pointer receiver gives access to the original struct's fields.

### Q20: "Where did :8080 come from and where else would we possibly need the constructor?"
**A:** `:8080` came from passing it to the constructor. Constructors are useful for any struct with required fields, setup details, or to prevent initialization mistakes.

## COMMON ERRORS AND FIXES

### Error 1: `cannot use 10 (untyped int constant) as *int value in assignment`
```go
var age *int
age = 10  // ❌ Error
```
**Fix:** `age = &10` or create variable first

### Error 2: `invalid operation: cannot indirect userID (variable of type int)`
```go
userID := 42
fmt.Println(*userID)  // ❌ Error
```
**Fix:** `fmt.Println(userID)` (remove the *)

### Error 3: `undefined: UserID`
```go
fmt.Println(*UserID)  // ❌ Error - case sensitive
```
**Fix:** `fmt.Println(*userID)` (lowercase)

### Error 4: `too many return values have (error) want ()`
```go
func (s *APIServer) Run() {  // No return type declared
    return http.ListenAndServe(s.addr, router)  // But trying to return
}
```
**Fix:** Add return type: `func (s *APIServer) Run() error`

### Error 5: `could not import github.com/gorilla/mux`
**Fix:** `go get github.com/gorilla/mux`

### Error 6: `main redeclared in this block`
**Fix:** Only one `main` function per package. Move to different directories or packages.

## KEY RULES TO REMEMBER

1. **Pointers store addresses, not values**
2. **`&` gets address, `*` dereferences or declares pointer type**
3. **Methods with receivers are attached to types**
4. **Value receivers work on copies, pointer receivers work on originals**
5. **Constructors build objects, methods use objects**
6. **Use pointers when you need to modify the original struct**
7. **Any function with a receiver `(s *Type)` becomes a method**
8. **Go is case-sensitive: `User` ≠ `user`**
9. **Receivers must use types, not variables**
10. **"When in doubt, use a pointer receiver"**

---

## THE COMPLETE FLOW

1. **Constructor** creates struct and returns pointer
2. **Variable** holds the pointer (address)  
3. **Method calls** pass the pointer via receiver
4. **Method** works on the original struct (if pointer receiver)
5. **Changes persist** after method returns
